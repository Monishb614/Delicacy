<h><strong>Cancellation Window:</strong></h><p>There may be a specific time frame within which you can cancel your online order and request a refund. This window is often before the restaurant starts preparing the order.</p><hr>

<h>Partial Refunds:</h> <p>If you cancel your order within the specified time frame, the restaurant may offer a partial refund. This could be to cover any processing fees or costs incurred by the restaurant for processing your order.</p><hr>

<h>Full Refunds: </h><p>In some cases, if you cancel well before the restaurant begins preparing your order, you might be eligible for a full refund of the order amount.</p><hr>

<h>No Refunds After Preparation:</h><p> Once the restaurant starts preparing your order, they might not offer any refunds, or only partial refunds, as they have already invested time and resources into preparing the food.</p><hr>

<h>Refund Process:</h><p>The restaurant may have a specific process for requesting a refund. This could involve contacting their customer service through a provided email or phone number and providing details about your order.</p><hr>

<h>Credit or Reorder:</h><p> Instead of a monetary refund, the restaurant might offer you a credit for a future order or allow you to reorder items of equivalent value.</p><hr>

<h>Special Circumstances:</h><p>Some restaurants may be more lenient with their refund policies for certain circumstances, such as incorrect or missing items, food quality issues, or delivery problems.</p><hr>

<h>Delivery Platforms:</h><p>If you placed your order through a third-party delivery platform (like Uber Eats, Grubhub, etc.), the refund policies might be subject to the terms and conditions of that platform.</p><hr>
